Dear Members,

Are you ready to take your USMLE Step 1 preparation to the next level? We are excited to announce our partnership with [**Med School Bootcamp**](https://bootcamp.com/med-school), a premier resource designed to help you excel in this critical exam! This collaboration marks a significant milestone for RSAP as we strive to empower our members throughout their medical education journey.

### About Med School Bootcamp & USMLE Step 1 Qbank Features
Med School Bootcamp is an all-in-one resource that stands out in preparing students for the Step 1 exam. What makes it unique? High-quality, up-to-date videos focus on applying high-yield concepts with mnemonics, tables, and diagrams—steering clear of the typical First Aid approach. These videos are paired with ‘bites’ (recall quizzes) to quickly test your understanding and track your progress.

Their Step 1 Qbank is meticulously designed to mirror the current exam’s style, content, and difficulty, featuring realistic questions complete with lab vitals, photos, and audio. And with a pass guarantee, it provides everything you need in one organized platform to confidently ace Step 1. Visit [https://bootcamp.com/med-school](bootcamp.com/med-school) to explore and learn more about how it can support your medical education.
