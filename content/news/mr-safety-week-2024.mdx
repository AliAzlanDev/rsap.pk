Dear Members,

Join RSAP in our week-long celebration of **MR Safety Week 2024**, from **July 22** to **July 27**!

This globally recognized event honors the memory of 6-year-old Michael Colombini, who tragically lost his life in 2001 due to an MRI-related accident involving a
steel oxygen cylinder brought into the MRI room during his examination. Such incidents emphasize the critical importance of MRI safety, and RSAP is dedicated to
raising awareness to prevent such tragedies in the future.

Throughout the week, we will share educational content and resources aimed at promoting MRI safety. We invite all our members as well as radiological students
and professionals to join us in this important observance and contribute to the ongoing improvement of MRI safety practices in Pakistan and internationally. By
actively participating in MR Safety Week, we can collectively ensure a safer MRI environment for patients and healthcare workers alike!

## Call to Action

We encourage you to share our posts, educational content, and resources on social media to raise awareness as far and as widely as possible. When posting,
please use the hashtags **#RSAP**, **#MRSafetyWeek**, **#MRSafety**, and **#MRISafety** to amplify our message and reach a broader audience.
