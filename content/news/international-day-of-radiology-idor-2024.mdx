Dear Members,

Today marks the **13th International Day of Radiology**! On this special day, radiology professionals worldwide come together to highlight the crucial role that medical imaging plays in enhancing patient care. We at the **Radiological Students' Association of Pakistan** (RSAP) are excited to join in celebrating radiology, the specialty that underpins modern medicine.

Radiology has transformed healthcare by improving diagnostics, guiding treatment, and ultimately improving patient outcomes. Whether you’re a medical student, a patient, or part of the radiology community, we invite you to join us in spreading awareness of the importance of this specialty. Let’s recognize and support radiology’s contributions on **#IDoR2024**!
